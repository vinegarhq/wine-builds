# VinegarHQ Wine Builds

This repository serves as the place to fetch a Wine build from Vinegar.

As there are multiple issues that can occur in a default installation of Wine,
some patches are necessary to improve the user experience of Wine to better 
run Roblox Studio, notably for fixing flickering issues with DXVK, and other
Wine regressions.
